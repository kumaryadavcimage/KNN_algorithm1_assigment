    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and intuitive supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In classification tasks, it predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors.\n",

    "1.Training Phase: During the training phase, the algorithm simply stores all the training data points and their corresponding labels or values.\n",

    "3.Nearest Neighbors Selection: The algorithm selects the k nearest neighbors to the new data point based on the calculated distances.\n",

    "2.Grid Search: Grid search involves evaluating the model's performance for a range of k values. Typically, a predefined range of k values is selected, and the algorithm's performance is measured using a performance metric such as accuracy (for classification) or mean squared error (for regression).\n",

    "4.Domain Knowledge: Domain knowledge can also guide the selection of k. For example, if you know that the classes in your dataset are well-separated, you may choose a smaller value of k. Conversely, if the classes are more overlapping, a larger value of k may be appropriate.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Equalizing Feature Influence: KNN relies on the notion of distance to determine the similarity between data points. If features have different scales or units, those with larger magnitudes may dominate the distance calculations, leading to biased results. Feature scaling ensures that all features contribute proportionately to the distance calculations, preventing any single feature from dominating the outcome.\n",

    "- Improving Convergence: Feature scaling can help improve the convergence of the algorithm during the training phase. By scaling features to a similar range, it can help the algorithm converge faster, leading to quicker training times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling Units and Magnitudes: Features with different units and magnitudes can pose challenges for distance-based algorithms like KNN. For example, if one feature represents measurements in meters and another feature represents measurements in kilograms, their magnitudes differ significantly. Feature scaling transforms the data to a comparable scale, making it easier for the algorithm to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distance Metric Sensitivity: Certain distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance, are sensitive to differences in feature scales. Feature scaling can help mitigate this sensitivity and ensure that distance calculations accurately reflect the true similarity between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common techniques for feature scaling include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Min-Max Scaling: Scales features to a specified range (e.g., [0, 1]) by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range (difference between maximum and minimum values).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardization (Z-score normalization): Centers the data around zero and scales it to have unit variance by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.\n",
